Apps are not the real apps in django.

They are the small tiny components of the main application

$python manage.py startapp myapp
--------------------------------------------------------------

folder structure :

migrations
__init__.py              - to make the myapp folder into python module
admin.py                 - to associate this app into the admin
apps.py                  - New thing from django for app config. Leave as it is
models.py                - map our data into database
test.py                  - to automate the testing
views.py                 - display

Models and Views are the core of an app

So start with Models.

Once model is set up inside the app, add the app into settings.py in source
under the installed app section.

Note: Name of the app is added into installed app of settings.py not the class name of the models.py in the app
