Process:

Client -> URL -> Domain Name Server (DNS) -> Web hosted Server -> Apache -> Django Project -> handles flow of data -> actual files in machine

-------------------------

Django - Project :

$ django-admin.py startproject blog     # later change it to src or source so that it doesnt conflict with another folder inside it with same name

$ cd blog

manage.py                   # handles most of the django built in functions , not edited
blog                        # directory with same name as root. Therefore change root to source or src
  __init__.py               # tells the folder is a python file
  setting.py                # to set all the default stuffs
  urls.py                   # manage urls requests
  wsgi.py                   # Allows the project to be in a deployable application

$ python manage.py          # gives all the commands supported by manage.py

Django-project looks for these above files

1. settings.py -- A place to set up all the defaults for the project
  * Database
  * Installed Apps
  * static files
  * admin info

2. urls.py -- All urls for django to handle the request

https://mysite.com -> this Url -> comes to Django -> looks for -> urls.py

urls.py has -> url(r'^$','geolocate.views.home'),

r'^$'  -- url pattern
geolocate -- app
views - view.py
home  - function inside views.py

Its better to have seperate app for specific functionalities even though its possible to bundle all the apps into one (not recommended)

3. Creating app

$ django-admin.py startapp myapp or    -- in the previous url geolocate is the app name
$ python manage.py startapp myapp

* myapp
__init__.py
models.py
tests.py
views.py
