1. Setup - using virtualenv_sublime_pycharm or django_folder_structure
2. super_user
3. app
4. models.py in app
5. settings.py in src
6. Migrate in terminal - python manage.py migrate
   this gives migration has changed but not applied. So it says models has changed but not pushed to DB for sync

7. So run - python manage.py makemigrations
8. again run - python manage.py migrate
this ll make sure db is in sync with the models.
