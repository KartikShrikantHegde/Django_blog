# first time when this is run

$ python manage.py runserver

there will be migration errors.

so changes to django project need to be migrated to database. so django is not really synced to db

$ python manage.py migrate        # this runs the migrations or creates new tables in db

creating superuser:
_____________________

$ python manage.py createsuperuser

enter username,email,password -- done

----------------------

Database - django creates db.sqlite database which is set up in settings.py.
           This is done as default for us.

----------------------

Admin : http://127.0.0.1/admin/

enter previously given username and password

admin is already there as an installed app in settings.py

we can add new user. this will be added to database with migration
